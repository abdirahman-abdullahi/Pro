<h1>ABOUT US</h1>
<p>
    Mercedes-Benz traces its origins to Karl Benz 's creation of
    the first internal combustion engine in a car, the Benz Patent Motorwagen,
    financed by Bertha Benz 's dowry and patented in January 1886,
    and Gottlieb Daimler and engineer Wilhelm Maybach 's conversion of a
    stagecoach by the addition of a petrol engine later that year. <br>
